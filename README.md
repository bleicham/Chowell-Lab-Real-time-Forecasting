# Chowell Lab Real-time Forecasting Hub 

This GitHub repository contains weekly real-time forecasts related to multiple infectious diseases in the United States and the ongoing mpox outbreak in Africa. We use various modeling frameworks to produce forecasts each week, including:

1. **n-sub-epidemic framework** [1]  
2. **Spatial-wave framework** [2]  
3. **Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model** [3]  
4. **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)** [3]  
5. **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)** [3]  
6. **Facebook's Prophet model (Prophet)** [3]  
7. **Compartmental models** [4]  

Additionally, we estimate the weekly R(t) for mpox for both the United States and the ongoing outbreak in Africa.

We forecast four weeks out, and the table below provides additional details regarding the assumed error structure and calibration period used for each disease/geography.

The data displayed in the dashboard and used for all forecasts is obtained each Friday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5] and from the Our World in Data GitHub [6]. Forecasts are published each Sunday. All forecasting tools used to obtain forecasts and visualizations can be found in the references below.
